# Web application for exploration of acoustic telemetry data
Web application to analyze acoustic telemetry data. 
The application was developed using R Shiny and leverages unsupervised machine learning methods on the backend to explore behaviour of the tagged species. 
The overall goal is to have an automated tool that performs the analysis thereby giving managers and researchers that utilize telemetry for their research ample time to logically evaluate results and guide their decision-making.
