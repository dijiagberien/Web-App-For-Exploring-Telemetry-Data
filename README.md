# Web application for exploration of acoustic telemetry data
Web application to analyze acoustic telemetry data. 
The application was developed using R Shiny and leverages unsupervised machine learning methods to explore behaviour of the tagged species. 
The overall goal is to have an automated tool that performs the analysis thereby giving managers and researchers the opportunity to accelarate transition from data collection to decision-making.
